# djangoexample
Sample Django + AWS IaC

Step 1 is to get the code to create a django web app:
Im going to be honest, i never worked with django before so I followed the following tutorials online:
a)https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/series/2017/09/04/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-django-part-1.html
b)https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-django-and-set-up-a-development-environment-on-ubuntu-16-04
c)https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-django-views 
Since (a) is windows based and I spun up a linux vm in Azure to be my dev worksstation, i had to use digital ocean's tutorial(b,c) alongside the instructions so i could understand how django worked.  Also quick shout out to the cool dudes at DigitalOcean - I met a few of them at last year's thatconference!
